## ‚öôÔ∏è Approach to Development
I enjoy addressing challenges across all levels of the software stack, from optimizing code for performance to exploring the intricacies of retro systems to understand their inner workings. Whether working with modern systems or resource-constrained environments, I find satisfaction in solving practical problems and improving efficiency.

I prefer **C** for its flexability and efficiency, but I have experience with a range of programming languages, giving me flexibility in how I approach development tasks. I‚Äôm also passionate about **open-source software**‚Äîthe freedom to collaborate and share knowledge is what drives innovation.
